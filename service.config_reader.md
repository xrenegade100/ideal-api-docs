## <kbd>class</kbd> `ConfigReader`
Deprecated utility class for reading configuration settings. Something was wrong with this class anyways. VSCode will complain about types cause `__get_config_setting` should accept self as first argument.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `read_config`

```python
read_config(section, name)
```
